git commit -m "Profile Page:
Implemented conditional rendering for profile information to ensure UI components are only displayed when data is available from the API call.
Added a loading indicator to provide feedback to users while waiting for data to be fetched.

Add Friend/Edit Profile Button:
Conditionally rendered the "Add Friend" button or "Edit Profile" button based on whether the current user matches the profile user.

Background and Profile Picture Handling:
Improved handling of background and profile pictures, including fallback URLs for missing images.
Ensured proper rendering of images by checking for null values before using them in the UI.


General Improvements:
Refactored code for readability and maintainability.
Added comments and documentation to clarify code functionality and usage.
These updates enhance the user experience and ensure consistency and reliability in the profile page rendering and functionality."
